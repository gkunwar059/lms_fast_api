# Let's break down the provided code snippet and explain each part along with its purpose and usage:

# python

# async def __call__(self, request: Request) :

# This defines the __call__ method of the JwtBearer class. The __call__ method is a special method in Python that is invoked when an instance of the class is called as a function. In this case, it's used to handle incoming requests.

# python

# credentials= await super(JwtBearer, self).__call__(request)

# This line invokes the __call__ method of the parent class (HTTPBearer) using the super() function. It extracts and parses credentials from the request headers asynchronously. The result (credentials) contains information about the extracted credentials.

# python

# if credentials:

# This checks if credentials were extracted successfully. If credentials exist, it proceeds to further verification.

# python

# if not credentials.scheme == "Bearer":

# This condition checks if the extracted credentials have the correct authentication scheme. In this case, it ensures that the scheme is "Bearer."

# python

# raise HTTPException(
#     status_code= 403,
#     detail= "Invalid or expired Token!"
# )

# If the authentication scheme is not "Bearer" or if no credentials were extracted, it raises an HTTPException with a status code of 403 (Forbidden) and a detail message indicating an invalid or expired token.

# python

# if not self.verify_jwt(credentials.credentials):

# This condition checks if the JWT token extracted from the credentials is valid by calling the verify_jwt method.

# python

# raise HTTPException(
#     status_code=403,
#     detail="Invalid or expired token"
# )

# If the JWT token is invalid or expired, it raises an HTTPException with a status code of 403 and a detail message indicating an invalid or expired token.

# python

# return credentials.credentials

# If the credentials are valid and the JWT token is verified successfully, it returns the extracted credentials. These credentials can then be used to access protected resources.

# python

# def verify_jwt(self, jwtoken:str):

# This defines the verify_jwt method of the JwtBearer class. It's responsible for verifying the validity of a JWT token.

# python

# return Auth.decode_token(jwtoken) is not None

# This line verifies the JWT token by calling the decode_token method from the Auth class. If the decoded token is not None, it means the token is valid, so it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

# Summary:
# The JwtBearer class extends FastAPI's HTTPBearer security scheme to handle JWT-based authentication. The __call__ method is invoked to handle incoming requests, extract credentials, and verify the JWT token. If the token is valid, it allows access to protected resources; otherwise, it raises an error. The verify_jwt method verifies the validity of the JWT token.
